Upon making my way this year to Google Summer of Code 2014, I’ll be working for Mozilla’s project Instantbird. My task is to add video and voice calling support to the XMPP protocol using WebRTC. My detailed proposal is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbcWc1v5H_t0MzezNkvmzxM1wt0jvZI4vJG3CxCZR4A/edit?usp=sharing).

### About Instantbird:

[![Instantbird](http://instantbird.com/images/instantbird-logo.png)](http://instantbird.com)  
For all those who don’t know about this amazing chat client, [Instantbird](http://instantbird.com) is a Mozilla Firefox based multiple chat client for Windows, Mac and Linux which supports protocols like XMPP, GTalk, Yahoo, Facebook, IRC, ICQ and multiple others. It is simple and powerful and can be used to manage all Real Time Communications.

Hoping to make the most of it this summer!
